# Tarnished Trials

This is the code repository for [Tarnished Trials](http://tarnishedtrials.com/). This site was made to help keep track of challenge builds and share interesting ways to replay Elden Ring.

## Contributing

There are a few ways to contribute. 

### Submit a Pull Request

If you have a developer environment setup, simply fork this repo and submit a Pull Request with new challenge builds as markdown files. The challenges are located at docs/_challenges and are standard markdown with Frontmatter. This can also be done directly from Github by adding a new file or using the edit button on the desired file.

### Submit an Issue

[Create a new Issue](https://github.com/notoriousb1t/tarnishedtrials/issues/new/choose) in this repository detailing the Challenge Run Idea including what is needed to win, any restrictions, and most importantly, what cosplay is necessary!

Please note that if a challenge run is sufficiently close to another existing one, it may be added as a variant or you may be asked to come up with something to make it more unique.
