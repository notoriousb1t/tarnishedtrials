## Objective

Collect all Katanas, Great Katanas, and also Wakazashi in the playthrough. The game is won once all of these weapons are in your inventory and the Elden Beast is defeated. This challenge requires accessing Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, and a number of bosses that are optional in a typical playthrough. This is intended for New Game, and not subsequent Journeys and should be considered very challenging for most players.

## Rules

- Only Katanas, Great Katanas, and Wakizashi may be equipped after leaving the Chapel of Anticipation
- New Game only
- Any ending
- No Spirit Ashes 
- No NPC Summons

## Setup

No setup is required.
