## Overview

Collect all Katanas, Great Katanas, and also Wakazashi in the playthrough. The game is won once all of these weapons are in your inventory and the Elden Beast is defeated. This challenge requires accessing Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, and a number of bosses that are optional in a typical playthrough. This is intended for New Game, and not subsequent Journeys and should be considered very challenging for most players.

## Rules

- New Game only
- Any ending
- Only Katanas, Great Katanas, and Wakizashi may be equipped after leaving the Chapel of Anticipation
- (optional) No Spirit Ashes or NPC Summons are allowed

## Setup

No specialized setup is required.

## Notes

- [Wakizashi](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Wakizashi){:target="_blank"} can have [Parry](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Parry+Skill){:target="_blank"} and can be powerstanced with itself and other Katanas when in the left hand.
- Giving an Iris of Grace to Jolan is a lose condition, See [Sword of Night](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sword of Night){:target="_blank"}
- Defeating Golden Hippopotamus and Rellana are optional
- Upgrading Scadutree Blessing to at least level 9 makes the required bosses in the Lands of Shadow significantly easier
- For Dex + Arcane, consider starting with [Samurai](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Samurai){:target="_blank"}. This allows for powerstancing [Uchigatana](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Uchigatana){:target="_blank"}
- For Dagger builds, have a friend drop a [Wakizashi](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Wakizashi){:target="_blank"} and consider start with [Bandit](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bandit){:target="_blank"}. This allows powerstancing daggers and performing parry + riposte
