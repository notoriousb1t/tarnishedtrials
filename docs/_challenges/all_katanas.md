## Overview

Collect all Katanas, Great Katanas, and also Wakazashi. The game is won once all of these weapons are in your inventory and the Elden Beast is defeated. This challenge requires accessing Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, and a number of bosses that are optional in a typical playthrough. This is intended for New Game, and not subsequent Journeys and should be considered very challenging for most players.

## Rules

- New Game only
- Any ending
- Only Katanas, Great Katanas, and Wakizashi may be equipped after leaving the Chapel of Anticipation
- No Spirit Ashes or NPC Summons are allowed

## Notes

- Arcane builds are effective against most required bosses
- Giving an Iris of Grace to Jolan is a lose condition, See [Sword of Night](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sword of Night){:target="_blank"}
- Defeating Golden Hippopotamus and Rellana are optional
